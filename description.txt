[b]The map is being majorly overhauled (All the world) and the lore is being rewritten. We are currently looking for experienced devs to help us with the map change to get you this update as soon as possible! If you wish to join the team, join the discord and let me (Captain Gen) know![/b]

The Ottomans lost WWI and had to leave the Middle East due to increased revolutions. The British and the French were so preoccupied with other parts of the World that they did not colonize the Middle East. Countries started to rise and became independant right after the Ottomans left. Will you play to become an Old Empire? Or will you become a new Empire? Or will you fight for the freedoms of humanity? Find out in Ottoman Ashes!
