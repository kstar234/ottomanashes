  POLITICS_GARVEY_DESC:0 "Marcus Mosiah Garvey Jr. was a proponent of Black nationalism in the United States and most importantly Jamaica. He was a leader of a mass movement called Pan-Africanism and he founded the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League (UNIA-ACL). He also founded the Black Star Line, a shipping and passenger line which promoted the return of the African diaspora to their ancestral lands. Although most American Black leaders condemned his methods and his support for racial segregation, Garvey attracted a large following."
