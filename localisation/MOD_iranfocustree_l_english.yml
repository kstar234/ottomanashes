  #Kurdish Threat
  persiaft.0.t:0 "The Kurdish Threat"
  persiaft.0.d:0 "For centuries, the eastern Kurds have been under the foot of Persia. It is, only now, they cite their want for independence, at such an unstable time in Iranian history. While the changing of the name of Persia to Iran has helped cool tensions in the region, it is uncertain whether the Iranian Kurds will rise up again, like they did on Sept. 16th, 1933. This revolt was squashed on Oct. 14th of the same year, but we cannot risk another revolt.\n\nWhat shall we do with these dissenters?"
  persiaft.0.a:0 "Give them harsh punishments"
  persiaft.0.b:0 "Give them light sentences"
  persiaft.1.t:0 "Kurdish Riots"
  persiaft.1.d:0 "The Kurds have rosen up in riots! They appear to want independence, so it only seems like a matter of time until they try to break away. We can either punish the Kurds, which may lead to an uprising, or we can let these incidents go, though that would certainly decrease stability in the region.\n\nWhat shall we do with these riots?"
  persiaft.1.a:0 "Punish the culprits!"
  persiaft.1.b:0 "Let it slide"
  persiaft.2.t:0 "Kurdish Riots End"
  persiaft.2.d:0 "It seems like the Kurdish riots have ended. Buildings and infrastructure within Iranian Kurdistan have stopped being torched and there are no longer open calls for the Kurds there to join Kurdistan. We can now rest in peace knowing that we no longer have to deal with the Kurdish threat."
  persiaft.2.a:0 "Let us rejoice"
  persiaft.3.t:0 "Kurdish Uprising"
  persiaft.3.d:0 "It seems like the Kurdish riots have escalated into all out rebellion! Kurdistan has issued a declaration stating that they now control Iranian Kurdistan, and are now sending in their own troops. Our advisors implore you to do an armed intervention, however, a diplomatic solution, offering the Kurds foreign aid in exchange for Iranian Kurdistan to be given back, may yield better results for Iran.\n\nWhat shall we do?"
  persiaft.3.a:0 "Squash the rebellion!"
  persiaft.3.b:0 "Work towards a diplomatic solution"
  persiaft.3.c:0 "Let it go"
  persiaft.4.t:0 "The Iranians Want to Talk"
  persiaft.4.d:0 "The Iranians have come to us with an offer. They want us to cede the territory we rightfully took back to them, in exchange for foreign aid. This foreign aid would help us extremely against rivaling countries, however, our people in Kurdistan would see us as traitors. If we refuse, the Iranians might declare war, however, they might even add more to their offer."
  persiaft.4.a:0 "Don't budge"
  persiaft.4.b:0 "Agree to the demands"
  persiaft.5.t:0 "Kurdistan Accepts Our Offer"
  persiaft.5.d:0 "The Kurds have accepted our fair offer, and have returned our rightful land."
  persiaft.5.a:0 "Now we can continue in peace"
  persiaft.6.t:0 "Kurdistan Refuses Our Offer!"
  persiaft.6.d:0 "The Kurds have refused our fair offer. We now have three options. We can attack, offer a better deal, for them, or simply let the Kurds have our territory."
  persiaft.6.a:0 "Attack!"
  persiaft.6.b:0 "Offer another, better, deal"
  persiaft.6.c:0 "Let it go"
  persiaft.7.t:0 "The Iranians Sent Another Offer"
  persiaft.7.d:0 "The Iranians have come to us with another offer. This time, they will give us even more aid in return for 'their land' back. However, they do assure us that they will go no further. So, will we accept this, much better, offer? Or shall we decline once more?"
  persiaft.7.a:0 "Decline"
  persiaft.7.b:0 "Accept"
  persiaft.8.t:0 "The Kurds Have Refused Again!"
  persiaft.8.d:0 "The Kurds have once again refused our, even fairer, offer. We cannot engage in further diplomacy. We must either abandon Kurdistan all together, or fight the Kurds to get it back."
  persiaft.8.a:0 "This diplomatic process has yielded us nothing!"
  persiaft.8.b:0 "Back down"
  #Azerbaijani Threat
  persiaft.9.t:0 "The Azerbaijani Threat"
  persiaft.9.d:0 "The Azerbaijanis have been protesting ever since the Tabriz Massacre occured on November 23rd, 1935. These protests have been relatively non-violent, however their refusal to give us crucial machine tools from their factories is giving the rest of our country headaches. We could increase police presence, or we could let our military do the policing."
  persiaft.9.a:0 "Send in the Police"
  persiaft.9.b:0 "Establish a permanant military presence"
  persiaft.9.c:0 "Establish an extensive military presence"
  persiaft.10.t:0 "Breakup of the Caucusus"
  persiaft.10.d:0 "The communist Caucusus nation is breaking apart. We can use this opportunity to take some of their land before rebels secure it for themselves, if we properly prepared."
  persiaft.10.a:0 "If only we could take advantage of this..."
  persiaft.10.b:0 "Use this opportunity"
  persiaft.10.c:0 "Abuse this opportunity"
  persiaft.10.e:0 "Let this pass"
  #Asking for British Help
  persiaft.11.t:0 "Iranians Desire Help"
  persiaft.11.d:0 "The Irani monarchy has decided to ask for us for some help. Providing them help could allow us to foster relations with them, but it will take up valuable time and resources to do so."
  persiaft.11.a:0 "Give them support"
  persiaft.11.b:0 "Just give them some vocal support"
  persiaft.12.t:0 "The British Give Support"
  persiaft.12.d:0 "After recieving a letter, asking for support from the British Government to help us stay in power, they decided to agree to our request."
  persiaft.12.a:0 "We thank our new British friends!"
  persiaft.13.t:0 "The British Refused Support"
  persiaft.13.d:0 "After recieving a letter, asking for support from the British Government to help us stay in power, they decided to reject to our minute request."
